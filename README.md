# Blockchain UI

This is hosted for your convenience: [https://blockchain-challenge.firebaseapp.com/](https://blockchain-challenge.firebaseapp.com/)

Because of `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'` problems, I've attached a gif of it working:

### Running

This was ran locally on firebase. If you'd like, clone, then run it with `firebase init`, and `firebase serve` if you want to run it locally as well.

### Thoughts

Originally, I wanted to use React for this, but I wanted to really showcase my UX/UI development. That said, I would know how to approach this if given more time.

I also wanted to take the chart X, Y data from the API call, but there was the whole problem with cors.
