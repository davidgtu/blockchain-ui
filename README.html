<p>This is hosted for your convenience: <a href="https://blockchain-challenge.firebaseapp.com/">https://blockchain-challenge.firebaseapp.com/</a></p>

<p>This was ran locally on firebase. If you&#39;d like, clone, then run it with <code>firebase init</code>, and <code>firebase serve</code> if you want to run it locally as well.</p>

<p>Originally, I wanted to use React for this, but I wanted to really showcase my UX/UI development. That said, I would know how to approach this if given more time.</p>
<p>I also wanted to take the chart X, Y data from the API call, but there was the whole problem with cors.</p>
